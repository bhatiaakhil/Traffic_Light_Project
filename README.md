# Traffic_Light_Project

### Project Title: 
Traffic Light Controller
### HDL: 
Verilog 
### EDA Tools: 
Modelsim (Questa), VCS
### Description: 
Designed a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog HDL with FSM-based logic and counters to manage signal timing across multiple states. Simulation outputs were analyzed and debugged using tools such as ModelSim and Synopsys VCS to ensure accurate state transitions, timing control, and logic integrity.
